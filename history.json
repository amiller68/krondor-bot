It was named after Sir George Everest who served as Surveyor General of India from 1830 to 1843. The summit ridge is the borderline, with one-third of it in Tibet and two-thirds in Nepal. Its massif includes several peaks over 8,000 metres (26,000 ft), including Lhotse (8,516 m or 27,940 ft) and Cho Oyu (8,201 m or 26,906 ft). The mountain has several well-documented climbing routes. In addition to the summit peak, there are many ridges, but few of them lead to the top.\nThe southern route from Nepal is shorter than the northern route from Tibet and was first used in 1953 by Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay on their historic ascent. This route has been used for most subsequent ascents, including those of Reinhold Messner who made a solo climb without supplementary oxygen.\nThe first recorded summit attempt was made by British climber George Mallory in 1924. He and his climbing partner Andrew Irvine disappeared on the mountain's north face while attempting to reach the summit. It is not known if they reached their goal or perished during their descent. The highest point of Mount Everest, called the \"summit,\" can be reached by several different routes that vary in difficulty depending upon factors such as weather conditions and individual climber skill level.\nThe southern route from Nepal involves a series of technical climbing sections with steep rock faces up to 80 degrees incline at times along with ice walls overhangs where ropes are used for safety purposes during certain portions due to the danger posed by falling rocks caused by melting snowpacks above these areas.\nThe northern route from Tibet involves crossing crevasses which require specialized equipment like ladders or metal bridges built across them, as well as traversing narrow ledges along vertical cliffs with little room for error before reaching the summit ridge where climbers must face strong winds blowing down off the top of Everest itself.\nThere are many risks associated with climbing Mount Everest including avalanches caused by shifting ice fields above certain sections that can suddenly release tons of snow and debris onto unsuspecting climbers below without warning; altitude sickness resulting from prolonged exposure to extreme heights where oxygen levels decrease significantly causing headaches, nausea, dizziness or even death if left untreated; hypothermia due to freezing temperatures encountered during certain parts of the climb especially at night when temperatures drop well below zero degrees Fahrenheit (-18 Celsius) requiring proper clothing insulation against wind chill factor.\nDespite these hazards thousands attempt annual expeditions up Mount Everest each year making it one of most popular tourist attractions despite its high mortality rate due to the dangers involved in reaching its peak.\nIn conclusion, Mount Everest is a massive mountain located on the border between Nepal and China with an elevation of 8,848 meters (29,032 ft) above sea level making it the highest peak in the world. Its massif includes several other peaks over 8,000 meters"}], "6987892396": [{"message_id": 1336, "from": {"id": 6987892396, "is_bot": false, "first_name": "Ebrog", "language_code": "en"}, "chat": {"id": 6987892396, "first_name": "Ebrog", "type": "private"}, "date": 1705528020, "text": "/start", "entities": [{"offset": 0, "length": 6, "type": "bot_command"}]}, {"message_id": 1338, "from": {"id": 6987892396, "is_bot": false, "first_name": "Ebrog", "language_code": "en"}, "chat": {"id": 6987892396, "first_name": "Ebrog", "type": "private"}, "date": 1705528042, "text": "Hello"}, {"message_id": 1340, "from": {"id": 6987892396, "is_bot": false, "first_name": "Ebrog", "language_code": "en"}, "chat": {"id": 6987892396, "first_name": "Ebrog", "type": "private"}, "date": 1705528061, "text": "What is your purpose?"}, {"message_id": 1337, "from": {"id": 6638025776, "is_bot": true, "first_name": "Libertai Staging", "username": "liberchat_staging_bot"}, "chat": {"id": 6987892396, "first_name": "Ebrog", "type": "private"}, "date": 1705528021, "reply_to_message": {"message_id": 1336, "from": {"id": 6987892396, "is_bot": false, "first_name": "Ebrog", "language_code": "en"}, "chat": {"id": 6987892396, "first_name": "Ebrog", "type": "private"}, "date": 1705528020, "text": "/start", "entities": [{"offset": 0, "length": 6, "type": "bot_command"}]}, "text": "Bot is thinking..."}, {"message_id": 1339, "from": {"id": 6638025776, "is_bot": true, "first_name": "Libertai Staging", "username": "liberchat_staging_bot"}, "chat": {"id": 6987892396, "first_name": "Ebrog", "type": "private"}, "date": 1705528043, "edit_date": 1705528090, "text": "Hello, how can I assist you today?
