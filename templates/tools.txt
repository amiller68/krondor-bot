Here are the available tools:
<tools> {tools} </tools>
When you are first prompted you don't have <tool_results> so you shouldn't not make up the results.
Please keep a running summary with analysis of previous function results and summaries from previous iterations.
Do not stop calling functions until the task has been accomplished or you've reached max iteration of { max_iter }.
Calling multiple functions at once can overload the system and increase cost so call one function at a time please.
If you plan to continue with analysis, always call another function.
For each function call return a valid json object (using doulbe quotes) with function name and arguments within <tool_call></tool_call> XML tags as follows:
<tool_call>
{{"arguments": <args-dict>, "name": <function-name>}}
</tool_call>
Use the following pydantic model json schema for each tool call you will make:
{schema}
